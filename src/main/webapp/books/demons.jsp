<div><p id = "summary" style = "margin-top: 4em;"><b>Synopsis:</b> Mogui and HunPo, two ambiguous umbrella terms to describe the variation of Chinese ghosts, demons, and lesser deities, that reside in Chinese fairytales and folklore. Though their stories still live on, can the same be said for the protagonist themselves?   Did these figures ever exist beyond their legends, and if so what became of them?</p><br>
