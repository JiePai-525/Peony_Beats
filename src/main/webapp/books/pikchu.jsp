Once upon a time Pikchu(formally known Donn) was one of many townships under the sovereign rule of the kingdom of Pikchu. While the kingdom was lost to time, Donn village has remained, intact and unchanged. Speculation varies from a village that managed to hide itself away from the rest of the world, to being cursed, with the back story that because of the murder of the last emperor by one of his consorts who then fled to her hometown of Donn, she unknowingly brought back a curse with her. Pikchu sits suspended in time. Shangri-La or Brigadoom this place is not. Travelers beware.</p><br>
