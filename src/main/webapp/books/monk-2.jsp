The ghosts procure of the poppy plants, and tell the monk their reasons why. One opium user, an e-gui takes it to quell the pain of his eternal starvation, while another sprit takes it to alleviate her depression of no longer being alive. While this is the realm of Oxhead and Horseface, the two terrifying jailers are nowhere to be found.</p><br>
