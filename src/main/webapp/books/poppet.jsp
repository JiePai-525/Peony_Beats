This book focuses on Sympathetic Magic as it pertains to imitation, as practitioners construct avatars of the intended person or items intended for said person in the form of fetishes. Fetishes can break down into objects that have powers over others, or objects that have supernatural powers. Aswamono and effigies are objects that have supernatural powers, while tishen, voodoo dolls, and poppets have power or influence over those they were constructed to imitate.  Yet all fetishes despite their culture of origin overlap in their purpose.</p><br>
