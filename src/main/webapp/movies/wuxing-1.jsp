Not to long ago Ms. Woo revealed to Chensha he is a vermillion bird, but ironically this means little to him. Chensha has no family outside of Ms. Woo, and the Vermillion Bird Community like the Fenghuag community Ms. Woo hails from are scattered and almost non-existent. When Ms. Woo falls ill, Chensha must seek out "The Center" to find a cure for her. </p><br>
